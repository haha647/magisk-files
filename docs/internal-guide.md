# Magisk Delta Internal Documentation

## Early-init mount

- Some files requires to be mounted earliest in the boot process, Magisk Delta has provided the way to mount files in `pre-init` stage, before `init` is executed
- The chose location to mount files is `$PRENITDIR/early-mount.d` which is located in same place (`$PREINITDIR`) with `sepolicy.rules` directory. Example your directory to store custom sepolicy rules is `/data/unencrypted/magisk` then the location to mount files is `/data/unencrypted/early-mount.d`
- You can place your files into the corresponding location under `early-mount.d` directory. For example, you want to replace `/vendor/etc/vintf/manifest.xml` and your mount directory is `/data/unencrypted/early-mount.d`, copy your `manifest.xml` to `/data/unencrypted/early-mount.d/system/vendor/etc/vintf/manifest.xml` , Magisk Delta will mount your files in the next rebootâ€‹
- Other files are not in `$PREINITDIR/early-mount.d/system` will be ignored.
- For module developers, you can use this path:
```
$(magisk --path)/.magisk/mirror/early-mount
```


**Early-init mount only support simple mount, which means it can replace files but cannot add new files, folders or replace folders**

## init.rc inject

- Feel annoying when you must repack boot image to inject custom `*.rc` script by using `overlay.d`? Magisk Delta has provide the way to inject custom `*.rc` script systemlessly!
- The chose location of custom `*.rc` script is `$PRENITDIR/early-mount.d/initrc.d`. Magisk Delta will inject all scripts in this folder into `init.rc` every boot.
- You can use `${MAGISKTMP}` to refer to Magisk tmpfs folder. Every occurrence of the pattern `${MAGISKTMP}` in your `*.rc` scripts will be replaced with the Magisk tmpfs folder when magiskinit injects it into `init.rc`.
- Magisk's mirror will not be available while booting, in order to access to `early-mount.d` directory. You can use this pattern `${MAGISKTMP}/.magisk/early-mount.d`.
- For module developers, you can use this path:
```
$(magisk --path)/.magisk/mirror/early-mount/initrc.d
```
- Here is an example of the `custom.rc` if you use `initrc.d`:

```
# Use ${MAGISKTMP} to refer to Magisk's tmpfs directory

on early-init
    setprop sys.example.foo bar
    insmod ${MAGISKTMP}/.magisk/early-mount.d/libfoo.ko
    start myservice

service myservice ${MAGISKTMP}/.magisk/early-mount.d/myscript.sh
    oneshot
```


## Remove files and folders

- Magisk provides the way to modify read-only system files by using modules while keeping system partition untouched. The beaty of Magisk modules is the changes are stored in data partition while it is visible in system partition. 

- Magisk modules can add or replace files into `/system`, `/vendor`, `/product` and `/system_ext`. However, magisk does not provide the way to make files in system disappeared.

- In Magisk documentation:

> It is complicated to actually remove a file (possible, not worth the effort). Replacing it with a dummy file should be good enough

> It is complicated to actually remove a folder (possible, not worth the effort). Replacing it with an empty folder should be good enough. Add the folder to the replace list in "config.sh" in the module template, it will replace the folder with an empty one

- In some case, replace file or folder with blank one is not enough and might cause issue. And some modding require files to be disappeared in order to take effect. So Magisk Delta has added removal support for modules. Replacing the target which you want to be deleted with the broken symlink point to `/xxxxx`. When Magic mount happened and detected this symlink, the target will be ignored and disappeared.

- Example creating symbolic link as `/data/adb/modules/mymodule_id/system/vendor/etc/thermal-engine-normal.conf`, the target `/vendor/etc/thermal-engine-normal.conf` will be ignored and disappeared:

```
ln -s "/xxxxx" /data/adb/modules/mymodule_id/system/vendor/etc/thermal-engine-normal.conf
```
