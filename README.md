## FAQ

### How to install Magisk Delta from start?

- Process like installing Magisk: <https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html>

### How to switch from current Magisk to Magisk Delta and vice versa?

Just do like when you update Magisk!

#### Direct Install (Recommended)

1. Install, open and then grant root acccess to Magisk Delta.
2. In **Magisk** section, tap "Install" and then "Direct Install". If you don't see this, try close and open the app.

#### Just flash Magisk Delta from current Magisk app

1. Rename the extension `magisk.apk` to `magisk.zip`
2. Open Magisk app, click "Modules" tab -> "Install from storage" and choose `magisk.zip`

### How do I run magisk on devices with exploit/temporarily root?

- Run your exploit root tool, you shall have root access after exploitation
- Push `magisk.apk` and `busybox` binary to `/data/local/tmp` and run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/1e6dbad3bbd68bf371511d8f6c1756db0ed61f80/scripts/avd_magisk.sh) with root access

***IMPORTANT! Do not update Magisk through Magisk app when bootloader is still locked or you will brick your device with modified boot image***


### How to install Magisk into emulator (such as NoxPlayer, LDPlayer, etc...)?

- Before start:

1. Only Magisk Delta support Magisk installation into system partition. 
2. Although emulator has ramdisk image, patching ramdisk is not used because ramdisk is stored in seperate partition with very SMALL disk size that is not enough to store Magisk binaries.
3. Bluestacks and MumuPlayer X will not be supported

- Step to step to install Magisk into emulator:

1. Enable Root access in emulator settings
2. Install and open Magisk Delta
3. Grant root access to Magisk Delta, click "Install" under Magisk field and use "Direct Install into system partition" option instead of "Direct Install" option. If you don't see this option, close and re-open Magisk Delta app.
4. Disable Root access in emulator settings.
    *Some emulators delete `su` executable after disabling root access, accidentally remove magisk's `su` so backup and delete `/system/xbin/su` instead.*

### Pass Safetynet / Play Integrity (Device Integrity)

1. Enable Zygisk or install Riru core
2. Enable MagiskHide and install [Safetynet Fix Mod](https://github.com/HuskyDG/safetynet-integrity-fix/releases/latest)
3. Reboot your device

Start with Magisk Delta 25202, to avoid [Tracer detection](https://github.com/vvb2060/magiskdetector), MagiskHide will start to rely on logcat to catch start up app process. For MagiskHide to work, do not disable logd. ROMs with abnormal or slow logcats will cause MagiskHide to work incorrectly. Hiding isolated process and app zygote is now possible in MagiskHide on Android 11 and higher. For Android 10 and bellow, because of isolated processes use the same with zygote's mount namespace, you will need [Riru-Unshare](https://github.com/vvb2060/riru-unshare/releases/latest) to force isolated processes's mount namespace to be detached.

### Why not restore Magisk modules online repo?

The official Magisk modules repository is dead and no longer maintained. Due to that, add them back is meanless. However, [Fox2Code](https://github.com/Fox2Code) has developed [Magisk Modules Manager](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager)  app which allows you to download Magisk modules online.
